# NextJS Smartcontract Lottery/Raffle

This nextjs-lottery is the front end application for my smartcontract-lottery repo. Here you can connect to your wallet and enter the Ether raffle by putting up 0.1 Ether. The raffle uses randomness from ChainLink to select a winner and the winner takes the pot.  

## Built with:
NextJS
Solidity
Chainlink
Moralis
web3uikit
Ethers
